## Make Change Project

#### Week 1 Skill Distillery assignment:

### Overview
Objective: design a program which takes input from a user and calculates the highest possible denominations of change returned
- Denominations that are not used will not be returned
- Display appropriate message if insufficient or exact amount

Methods: modulus operator, console input/output, method arguments and parameters

### How to Run
1. Type double value of an item's price (e.g. "43.55")
2. Type value of cash tendered
3. If cash tendered is less than the item's price, user will be prompted to enter a valid amount
4. System will output respective change in the highest combination of bills and coins

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Git

### Lessons Learned
Primary take-away: implementation of modulus operator and casting to determine specific values of an integer
Additional lessons:
- Organization of code through methods
- Usage of DecimalFormat subclass
- Conditional statements
